BTChip-Signing-Tools
====================

This is a collection of scripts used for signing messages and transactions with the BTChip HW.1 and Ledger Wallets (available on https://www.ledgerwallet.com)

This is very much a work in progress, and many things will change. 

Running
=======

To run the test code:

```
./setup.sh
# wait...
python sign.py --testnet
```

Setting up a new dongle
-----------------------

Fresh out of the box, the chip just needs to be loaded with a seed. If it already has one, run 
`python utils/resetChip.py`.

```
# Add --testnet to build a testnet key. They can only operate on one network at a time.
python utils/setupMnemonic.py
```

You can back up the mneomonic however you like. If you want to restore, run `python utils/restoreFromMnemnonic.py`.
The restore script also accepts the `--testnet` flag.

To generate an xpub/tpub for use with services like Coinkite:

```
# BIP32 roots are using the BIP44 standard, but they could be anything
# Mainnet
python utils/getKey.py 44h/0h/0h
# Testnet
python utils/getKey.py 44h/1h/0h
```

Co-signing a Coinkite request 
-----------------------------

To sign a request generated by Coinkite on a setup dongle, use 

```
python signTxCoinkite.py path_to_generated_Coinkite_json_request
```

Notes on BIP32 paths
--------------------

There are two competing formats for BIP32 paths. These are equivalent:

```
m/44h/0h/0h
44'/0'/0'
```

The `h` or `'` means it's a hardened key. For more on that, see the 
[BIP32 Spec](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#implications).

Notes on xpub/xpriv
-------------------

You can use `getKey.py` to generate pubkeys and addresses at different depths.

For the sake of demonstration we're using the path m/44h/1h/0h, which is the bip0044 path for 
account 0 on testnet. Say, we want to get the xpub to send to an external service like coinkite.

To get the pubkey and address at this path, call `getKey.py`:

```bash
> python getKey.py m/44h/1h/0h

Path: 44'/1'/0'

```

[Bip32gen](https://github.com/jmcorgan/bip32utils) (part of bip32utils) is really useful
for doing calculations on the keys, such as generating xprv/xpub at different trees.

For testing purposes, to get xprv, given a seed:

```
echo 1762F9A3007DBC825D0DD9958B04880284C88A10C57CF569BB3DADF7B1027F2D | bip32gen -i entropy -o xpub,addr,pubkey,xprv -v -f - -F - -x -X m/44h/1h/0h -n 256
```

To get tprv from xprv (`ku` comes from [pycoin](https://github.com/richardkiss/pycoin)):

```
ku xprv9zLs2b3Xog1e4gAUMFeXTkgaiAsWfJBgKTFjtCeEwSuGwtpshf2zdXALY7bFSaNNXGJRA98Xw9gaLtBMsDpSJDLDBomheqNqKtLyPga2uMG --override-network XTN
